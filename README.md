# Meng Project 
Our project developed a cloud-based information system that can manage, curate, analyze, and visualize datasets from BlackBird robot that can be used for plant phenotyping purposes. Our web system implemented a React-based interface for user interaction and a Django-based backend for data management and analysis. Besides, we also designed a PyTorch-based custom library for data pre-processing, model training, validation, and inference and utilized cloud storage technology for permanent large-scale data storage.
